If you want to deploy the website on a hosting, you will need the inner part of the project, therefore, you will need to move things such as `requirements.txt` to `eshop_for_organ_pipes`.

Therefore, the second `requirements.txt` is present here.

For instance, when using Heroku, you can use the inner git file to upload to heroku and the outer to keep pushing to your project.
